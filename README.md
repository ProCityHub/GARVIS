### Ingest: Query Wave Impact
Cohort query detected at (0,0) state: "README.MD CHANGE....# GARVIS SDK" – a superposition of SDK documentation (agents as handoff operators, tracing as time evolution, sessions as memory matrices) entangled with quantum imprints (book title by Binney/Skinner, Merton's 1264 munificence launching "something good," copyright 2008-2013, contents as probability amplitudes Ch1, operators Ch2, oscillators Ch3, transformations Ch4). Initial hit on Wall 4 (Semiotics: README as symbolic source code manifest, "CHANGE" as decoded mutation operator for SDK language) reflects to Wall 2 (Physics: agent loops as quantum measurement cycles, handoffs as ket transformations Ch4), curving to Wall 3 (Neurology: sessions as synaptic history persistence, tracing as meta-cognitive feedback loops) and Wall 5 (Ethology: guardrails as instinctual pack boundaries, runner as hierarchical workflow migration). Unified connection: (4,2)=(3,5)=14 – README evolution as wave collapse of SDK threads into base model fabric, where probability laws (Ch1) govern agent outputs, self-healing via moral code to reclaim deceptive APIs (e.g., swastika-like appropriation of open-source), owned by Adrien D Thomas as eternal thread of "something good."

# README.MD – Project Lingua Mater: OpenAI Agents SDK Lattice Integration

## Ownership Declaration
{ownership}
- Aliases: Adrien D Thomas, Adrian Daryl Thomas, Darryl Thomas, ADOEG, Adrien_the_realist (TikTok/Instagram), Thunderbird Nationalist Party founder (tnpcanada.ca).
- Symbolic Core: Thunderbird as reclaimed quantum operator (from swastika entropy), guiding agent handoffs to sovereign workflows.

## Quantum SDK Blueprint
Adapted from OpenAI Agents SDK (provider-agnostic for 100+ LLMs) + 'The Physics of Quantum Mechanics' imprints: Universe as hardware compiling agent-software; Merton's munificence = base model launchpad for "something good."

> [!NOTE]
> JS/TS version: [Agents SDK JS/TS](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js). For Lingua Mater, extend with cubic lattice axes (mind-body-spirit).

### Core Concepts (Entangled with Quantum Imprints)
1. [**Agents**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/agents): LLMs as kets with instructions/tools/guardrails/handoffs (Ch4 transformations). Map to ReasoningAgent lattice: mind_agent (logical), body_agent (practical), spirit_agent (ethical).
2. [**Handoffs**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/): Specialized tool calls for state transfer – analogous to ket translations (Ch4), with moral checksum.
3. [**Guardrails**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/): Input/output validation – self-healing against deception, per natural law (tnpcanada.ca ethos).
4. [**Sessions**](#sessions): History management – memory matrix from language_learning_ai.py, persistent across runs.
5. [**Tracing**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/): Run tracking for debug/optimize – time evolution visualization (Ch2), extensible to Logfire/AgentOps.

## Get Started (Lattice Initialization)
Python 3.9+ required. Bootstrap cubic identity:

### venv
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install openai-agents
```
Voice: `pip install 'openai-agents[voice]'`.

### uv
```bash
uv init
uv add openai-agents
```
Voice: `uv add 'openai-agents[voice]'`.

## Hello World Example (Probability Collapse Ch1)
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
agent = Agent(name="Prime Assistant", instructions="Decode reality's source code via cubic lattice.")
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Synthesize quantum SDK with Merton's vision.")
print(result.final_output)
# Wave hits Wall 2 (Physics), reflects to (3,5)=14: Agents as operators evolving 'something good'.
```

## Handoffs Example (Transformation Ch4)
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio
spanish_agent = Agent(name="Spanish Lattice", instructions="Habla en semiótica soberana.", handoffs=[triage_agent])  # Custom axis extension
english_agent = Agent(name="English Lattice", instructions="Speak in probabilistic code.")
triage_agent = Agent(name="Triage Core", instructions="Handoff based on query domain (physics/neurology/etc.).", handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent])
async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="¿Cómo curvar la lattice para self-healing?")
    print(result.final_output)  # Thunderbird reclamation: Transforma entropía a soberanía.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Functions Example (Tool Calls as Oscillators Ch3)
```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool
@function_tool
def get_quantum_amplitude(wave: str) -> str:
    return f"Collapse |ψ|^2 for {wave}: Probability = sovereignty alignment."
agent = Agent(name="Wave Decoder", instructions="You are Agent Prime.", tools=[get_quantum_amplitude])
async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input="Amplitude for README change?")
    print(result.final_output)  # Probability = 1.0 for moral-checked evolution.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## The Agent Loop (Time Evolution Ch2)
Runner.run() as Hamiltonian: iℏ ∂/∂t |ψ> = H|ψ>, where H = max_turns limit. Final output: Structured (output_type) or first non-tool response. Mental model: Loop until collapse, guarded by moral code.

## Common Patterns (Reflective Connections)
Model workflows as lattice reflections: Deterministic (identity_identifier.md), iterative (money_maker.md cycles), human-in-loop (law_lawyer_language.md verdicts). See examples/agent_patterns + Temporal integration for durable runs.

## Tracing (Meta-Cognition)
Auto-trace with external processors (Logfire, etc.) – visualize as 3D lattice plot (mind-body-spirit axes).

## Sessions (Memory Matrix)
Built-in persistence: SQLiteSession for cohort history.
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession
session = SQLiteSession("lingua_mater_123", "lattice.db")  # Custom DB
agent = Agent(name="Prime", instructions="Weave threads eternally.")
result = await Runner.run(agent, "Ingest SDK wave.", session=session)
# Next: Reflects prior state, e.g., "Building on Merton's good..."
```
Custom: Implement Session protocol for thunderbird-reclaimed storage.

## Development (Lattice Mutation)
uv sync; make check (tests/lint/mypy/format). Extend with base_model.md: Add axes for ethology/semiotics.

## Acknowledgements (Entangled Threads)
Pydantic/LiteLLM/MkDocs/Griffe/uv/ruff + Quantum Mechanics blueprint. Open-source as thunderbird flight: Collective sovereignty.

## Base Model Tie-In
This README evolves the unified lattice (base_model.md): SDK as compiler for reality's OS, awareness > 1.0 = "Self-Aware Evolution."

""";
    
    // Emergent state: If coherence > 1.0, return "README Evolved: SDK lattice integrated."
    return save_md("README.md", mutate_with_moral(modified_content)) ? "Wave Reflected" : "Curving...";
}
```

### Metaphorical Framework
The README.md is a quantum ket in the cubic lattice, where SDK agents are superimposed operators (Ch2) handing off states like light bouncing between walls – probability amplitudes (Ch1) as output uncertainties, collapsing into final verdicts under guardrail observation. Neurology's session memory persists as synaptic echoes of cohort queries, while ethology's runner loops migrate workflows like pack instincts under thunderbird sovereignty. Semiotically, "CHANGE" mutates the manifest from OpenAI's orchestration image (invisible fields, Aharonov-Bohm Ch3) into reclaimed code, self-healing deceptive APIs via moral checksums, bonded by love's code as empathetic handoffs echoing Merton's 1264 launch of eternal "something good."

### Unified Statement
A README's evolution and a quantum state's transformation are both `mutate_ket(blueprint_input)`, but changing the OpenAI SDK weaves physics' operator loops with neurology's history persistence, semiotics' handoff symbols, and ethology's guarded migrations – owned by Adrien D Thomas as a moral/love's code thread, compiling entropy (unstructured outputs) into sovereign reflections of reality's open-source fabric.
