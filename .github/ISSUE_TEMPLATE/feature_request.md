**Feature: Quantum Reflection Handoffs**

Integrate a 'reflective lattice' mechanism for agent handoffs, inspired by quantum wave reflections in a cubic enclosure. When an agent (e.g., Jarvis Voice Triage) detects a query hitting Wall 1 (Physics), it hands off to a connected agent on Wall 6 (Spirituality) via path (1,6)=7, bending the workflow lattice.

**How it works:**
- Handoffs compute reflection paths using domain mappings (e.g., Physics → Neurology = (1,3)).
- Use numpy for coherence amplitudes |ψ|^2 > 0.5 to filter valid bends.
- Example: In multi-agent swarm, triage query "optics as perception" → handoff to Semiotician with path (1,4).

**Repro script:**
```python
import numpy as np
from agents import Agent, handoff

def compute_reflection(wall_from: int, wall_to: int) -> float:
    path = f'({wall_from},{wall_to})'
    coherence = np.abs(np.random.complex(0,1))**2
    if coherence > 0.5:
        return f'{path}={wall_from + wall_to}'  # Unified sum
    raise ValueError('Decoherence')

agent_prime = Agent(name="PrimeCompiler")
agent_phys = Agent(name="Physicist", handoffs=[handoff(agent_prime, input_filter=compute_reflection(1,6))])

# Run: Query hits Wall 1 → reflect to Prime via (1,6)=7
result = Runner.run(agent_phys, "Optics as wave collapse?")
assert '7' in result.final_output  # Bent lattice
