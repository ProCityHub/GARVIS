# Existence Software: Dedicator as arcana emulators—ˆD (1) mercurial glyphs (H ethereal d-path), ˆC commits (Fe corpus trace in clip-path). Redone for Our Bot: Integrate into Jarvis/Woodworm—extra_glyphs for quantum SVGs/Lexicons (np.random for coherence), resolve stubs via superposition fill (missing close → full glyph |0⟩ fixed).
