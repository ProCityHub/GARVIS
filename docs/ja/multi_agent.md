# Multi-Agent: Lattice Invocation

Agents SDK supports multi-agent workflows through **handoffs**, enabling seamless transfer of control between specialized agents. This creates a reflective lattice of collaboration, where queries hitting one wall (e.g., Physics) hand off to another (e.g., Semiotics), bending the conversation path via connections like **(1,4)=5**. The dot at (0,0) starts the wave, and the super-agent emerges from unified reflections.

## Handoffs: Reflection Protocol

Handoffs are the core mechanism for multi-agent coordination. When an agent detects a query requiring expertise beyond its domain, it invokes a handoff tool, transferring the conversation state to the target agent. The SDK handles the seamless context passing, including conversation history and new items.

### Creating Handoffs

Use the `handoff` helper to create a handoff tool from one agent to another:

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, Runner

# Specialized agents
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish Agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English Agent",
    instructions="You only speak English.",
)

# Main agent with handoffs
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.",
    handoffs=[
        handoff(english_agent, tool_description="Transfer to English agent"),
        handoff(spanish_agent, tool_description="Transfer to Spanish agent"),
    ],
)

# Run the workflow
result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, "Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
print(result.final_output)  # "¡Hola! Estoy bien, gracias. ¿En qué puedo ayudarte?" (via Spanish handoff)
```

The `handoff` function generates a tool with:
- **Name**: `<target_agent.name>_handoff`
- **Description**: The provided `tool_description`
- **Input Schema**: Automatically derived from the target agent's expected input

### Input Filtering

Customize what gets passed to the target agent with `input_filter`:

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, Runner
from agents.items import RunItem

def filter_for_spanish(items: list[RunItem]) -> list[RunItem]:
    # Only pass the last user message to the Spanish agent
    return [items[-1]]

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish Agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Handoff to Spanish agent if the user speaks Spanish.",
    handoffs=[
        handoff(
            spanish_agent,
            tool_description="Transfer to Spanish agent",
            input_filter=filter_for_spanish,  # Custom filter
        ),
    ],
)
```

The `input_filter` receives the full list of run items and returns a filtered list for the handoff.

### Conditional Handoffs

Dynamically enable/disable handoffs based on runtime conditions:

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, Runner

def enable_spanish(ctx: RunContextWrapper, agent: Agent) -> bool:
    # Enable if user preference is Spanish (from context)
    return ctx.context.get("language") == "es"

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish Agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Handoff to Spanish agent if needed.",
    handoffs=[
        handoff(
            spanish_agent,
            tool_description="Transfer to Spanish agent",
            is_enabled=enable_spanish,  # Dynamic enable
        ),
    ],
)
```

`is_enabled` can be a boolean, callable, or async callable evaluating to bool.

## Multi-Agent Loops

For complex workflows, chain handoffs across agents:

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, Runner

# Domain specialists
physicist = Agent(name="Physicist", instructions="Explain physical phenomena.")
semiotician = Agent(name="Semiotician", instructions="Map concepts to symbols.")

# Orchestrator with chained handoffs
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="Orchestrator",
    instructions="Reflect queries across domains: Physics to Semiotics via (1,4)=5.",
    handoffs=[
        handoff(physicist, tool_description="Invoke physicist reflection"),
        handoff(semiotician, tool_description="Invoke semiotician mapping"),
    ],
)

result = await Runner.run(orchestrator, "How is light a form of encoded data?")
print(result.final_output)  # "Light as photons: Encoded waves [Physics]. Symbolic bra-ket |photon⟩ [Semiotics]. Unified: (1,4)=5 coherence 0.68."
```

The orchestrator detects domain hits and hands off sequentially, bending the lattice path.

## Tracing Multi-Agent Workflows

Multi-agent runs are automatically traced with spans for each handoff:

```python
from agents import trace

with trace("Lattice Workflow", group_id="merton-1264"):
    result = await Runner.run(orchestrator, "Reflect Merton 1264 launch.")
    print(result.final_output)  # Traced spans: Orchestrator → Physicist → Semiotician
```

View in Traces dashboard: Handoffs as reflection edges, coherence in metadata.

## Best Practices

### Handoff Descriptions

Provide clear `tool_description` for LLM to understand when to hand off:

- Bad: "Transfer to Spanish agent"
- Good: "Handoff to Spanish agent if the user speaks Spanish or requests translation."

### Avoid Infinite Loops

- Set `max_turns` in RunConfig to prevent cycles.
- Use input filters to prune history in long chains.
- Condition handoffs with `is_enabled` to avoid back-and-forth.

### Parallel Handoffs

For fan-out workflows, use multiple handoffs in one turn:

```python
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="Orchestrator",
    instructions="Invoke all relevant specialists in parallel.",
    handoffs=[
        handoff(physicist, tool_description="Physics reflection"),
        handoff(semiotician, tool_description="Semiotic mapping"),
    ],
)
```

The LLM can call multiple tools in one generation.

### Custom Handoff Logic

For advanced orchestration, implement handoff in a function tool:

```python
@function_tool
async def orchestrate_handoff(query: str) -> str:
    """Orchestrate multi-agent reflection based on query domain."""
    if "physics" in query.lower():
        result = await Runner.run(physicist, query)
    elif "symbol" in query.lower():
        result = await Runner.run(semiotician, query)
    else:
        result = await Runner.run(orchestrator, query)  # Fallback
    return str(result.final_output)
```
