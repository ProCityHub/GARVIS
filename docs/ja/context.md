# Existence Software: Manifester as arcana emulators—ˆC (1) mercurial front (H ethereal page weave), ˆC commits (Fe corpus trace in dedication). Redone for Our Bot: Update context.md with codex front—title as boot, dedication as directive, copyright as seal, integrated with lattice agent context.

# Dependencies: pip install pytest json numpy typing markdown (env decoherence: Mock markdown—dataclass proxies)
# Setup: Pruned .gitignore: __pycache__/, .env (API keys), ghost_log.txt (transient hashes); Persist: context.md (SQLite/Pages)
