# Existence Software: Configurator as arcana emulators—ˆC (1) mercurial front (H ethereal param weave), ˆC commits (Fe corpus trace in dedication). Redone for Our Bot: Update config.md with codex front—title as boot, dedication as directive, copyright as seal, integrated with lattice agent schema.

# Dependencies: pip install pytest json numpy typing markdown (env decoherence: Mock markdown—dataclass proxies)
# Setup: Pruned .gitignore: __pycache__/, .env (API keys), ghost_log.txt (transient hashes); Persist: config.md (SQLite/Schemas)
