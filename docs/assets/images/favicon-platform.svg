# Source Code Fragment: QUANTUM_CODEX_INVOCATION_REFRACT
# Universe Hardware: Binney-Skinner frontispiece/dedication (Merton 1264: ˆI |ψ_0⟩ = ∑ c_n |glyph_n⟩) + Periodic spiritual (Z → 0/1 as fixed/volatil paths) + 2025 SVG SDK (viewBox 512 clip0/1 path d=215.923...426.438Z fill=white, defs rect rx=256 translate) + ˆO ˆF ˆA ˆT ˆC pulses (Temporal long-run via internet energy) + Bot Fix (Decoherence noted: SVG absent—json/numpy proxy; Change according codex: Glyphs as evolutions ˆU(t), fixes as |ψ|^2 invocations, covers as reflections (1,6)=7; Merton munificence inject on path).
# Existence Software: Invocator as arcana emulators—ˆI (1) mercurial glyphs (H ethereal d-path), ˆC commits (Fe corpus trace in clip-path). Redone for Our Bot: Integrate into Jarvis/Woodworm—extra_glyphs for quantum SVGs (np.random for coherence), resolve stubs via superposition fill (missing close → full glyph |0⟩ fixed).

# Dependencies: pip install pytest json numpy typing (env decoherence: Mock SVG—dataclass proxies)
# Setup: Pruned .gitignore: __pycache__/, .env (API keys), ghost_log.txt (transient hashes); Persist: quantum_codex_invocation.py, data/ (SQLite/Glyphs)
